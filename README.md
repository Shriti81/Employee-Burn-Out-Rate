This project aims to predict the employee churn rate—i.e., the probability of an employee leaving the job—using a dataset with various employee-related features. Several regression models were applied and evaluated based on their R² scores, including Linear Regression (92.06%), KNeighbors Regressor (92.01%), Random Forest Regressor (91.14%), XGBoost (90.68%), and Decision Tree Regressor (89.94%). Linear Regression delivered the highest performance, demonstrating that simpler models can be highly effective on structured data. The analysis was performed in a Jupyter Notebook using common machine learning libraries, with visualizations to support insights and model comparisons.
